Here we go again. Another attempt at blogging, this time following a slightly modified version of [the KISS principle][kiss-principle]: Keep it simple: static! This version of the site is a [GitHub Pages site using Jekyll][gh-jkyl].

Hopefully I can find the motivation to document the things I'm working on and learning.
